This blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on Github Pages. The hardest part is perhaps the installation. I try to test the website locally before committing to the repo. I have different machines in different locations (office, home, etc.) and these machines are installed with different OS (MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu). Since it only seems right if I have proper environments for coding and blogging for all these machines, I end up spending far too much time setting up the environments for all my computers.

So everytime when I am thinking about buying a new compter, I have to think hard if I really need a new one. If I take into account the time I need to spend on setting up the environments, all the greater computing power that comes with the new machine suddenly does not seem that appealing any more. I also have to wonder if I could write code that fully utilize the power of these new machines. Otherwise, what's the point of spending the money and time replacing a perfectly functioning old one? In accounting, computers can be fully amortized and written off in 5 years. But here I am, coding, blogging, and testing my software in a 5-year-old windows PC and the resdiual value is far greater than 0. So in eseence the expense is over estimated the taxes underpaid. I am creating value in terms of expensing and taxing strategy. But somehow, that only applies to me. All the rest of the people in the company need to have their compuaters replaced in 2 to 3 years and usually it's because the machines just simply cannot power on any more. Have they done something really evil to their computers so that these machines just refuse to work any more?

Anyway, I hope the above makes sense to at least of some of the people reading the blog and I enjoy sharing my thoughts and ideas with you all!
